                    <h3>The Backstory</h3>
                    <p>
                    As the daughter of an army officer, I spent most of my life moving 
                    from place to place, adapting to new scenarios and cultures,
                    and meeting and connecting with people from all backgrounds. 
                    I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. A degree in 
                    science appealed to me because I love thinking through and solving problems. 
                    After graduation, a friend introduced me to software development.
                    I took a chance and joined Thinkful to start building a career in 
                    this quickly developing field. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When I am not working on the program, I like to unplug by hiking the 
                    beautiful mountains of Colorado and kayaking its many lakes and rivers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    For the future, I plan to: 
                    </p>
                    <!--ordered list-->
                        <ol>
                            <li>Finish the Thinkful program</li>
                            <li>Get a job in the programming field</li>
                            <li>Build awesome code</li>
                        </ol>
                    <p>
                    I am always willing to learn new things, and look forward to meeting with 
                    other developers and learning from them. Feel free to reach out to me!
                    </p>
